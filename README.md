# carpark-sentry (My First Python Project)  
> Built during my first startup internship in the summer of 2015.  

This simple script tracks cars that entered a parking lot but never exited.  
It processes an Excel file with two columns:  

- **col1**: Car addresses that entered  
- **col2**: Car addresses that exited  

The script then generates a new CSV (`filter_result.csv`) listing cars still inside the lot.
